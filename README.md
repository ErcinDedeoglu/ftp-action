**Automate File Transfer via FTP using GitHub Actions**

 - This GitHub Action allows you to automate the process of transferring
   files via FTP. Simply specify the source and destination directories,
   and the Action will handle the rest.

## Usage üíØ
To use this Action, you'll need to add it to your workflow file. Here's an example of how to do so:

```	
on: [push]

jobs:
  transfer_files:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Transfer files via FTP
      uses: ercindedeoglu/ftp-transfer-action@v1
      with:
        source: '/path/to/local/source/directory'
        destination: '/path/to/remote/destination/directory'
        host: 'ftp.example.com'
        user: 'your-ftp-username'
        password: 'your-ftp-password'
        options: "--delete --asci"
```

Replace the placeholders (e.g. your-username, /path/to/local/source/directory, etc.) with the appropriate values.


## Input parameters üî§

Input parameter | Description | Required | Default
--- | --- | --- | ---
host | The hostname of the FTP server | Yes | N/A
user | The username to use when connecting to the FTP server | Yes | N/A
password | The password to use when connecting to the FTP server | Yes | N/A
source | The local directory from which files will be transferred | No | .
destination | The remote directory to which files will be transferred | No | .
forceSSL | Force SSL encryption | No | false
options | Mirror command options | No | ''


## IMPORTANT üõéÔ∏è

**Don't forget to use GitHub Secrets to store your FTP credentials.**
This will help ensure that your password is kept secure and is not exposed in your workflow file.

To use GitHub Secrets, you'll need to store your FTP credentials as secrets in your repository settings. Then, in your workflow file, you can reference those secrets using the ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} syntax.

For example, to use the username and password secrets in the example above, you would modify the with block like so:

```
with:
  source: '/path/to/local/source/directory'
  destination: '/path/to/remote/destination/directory'
  host: ftp.example.com
  user: ${{ secrets.FTP_USERNAME }}
  password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
```

Remember to replace `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` with the actual names you gave to your secrets.
