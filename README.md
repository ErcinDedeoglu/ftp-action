## Prerequisites üìã

Before using this action, make sure you have access to an FTP server and your FTP credentials are securely stored as GitHub Secrets.

## How to Use üöÄ

Add this action to your GitHub workflow to start automating your file transfers. Here‚Äôs a basic setup guide:

1. Include this action in your workflow file after the checkout step.
2. Configure the action parameters such as source, destination, host, user, and password.
3. For security, use GitHub Secrets to handle sensitive information like FTP credentials.
4. Adjust additional settings like `forceSSL` and `options` as needed.

## Configuration Parameters üîß

Configure the FTP Transfer Action by setting the following parameters in your workflow file:

- `host`: The hostname or IP address of your FTP server. (Required)
  - Example: `ftp.example.com`

- `user`: Your username for the FTP server. (Required)
  - Example: `ftp_user`

- `password`: The corresponding password for your FTP server user account. (Required)
  - Example: Use `${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}` to securely fetch your password from GitHub Secrets.

- `source`: The local directory path in your repository from which files will be transferred. (Optional)
  - Default: `.` (current working directory)
  - Example: `./local_directory/`

- `destination`: The target directory path on your FTP server where files will be transferred. (Optional)
  - Default: `.` (home directory of the FTP user)
  - Example: `/public_html/`

- `forceSSL`: A boolean to enforce SSL encryption for the FTP transfer. (Optional)
  - Default: `false`
  - Example: `true` to enforce SSL encryption.

- `options`: Additional mirror command options for the `lftp` command. (Optional)
  - Default: `''` (no additional options)
  - Example: `"--delete --verbose"` to enable verbose logging and delete extraneous files from the destination.

Remember to wrap your input parameters in quotes if they contain special characters or spaces.

Here's how you might include these parameters in your workflow file:

```yaml
- name: Transfer files via FTP
  uses: ercindedeoglu/ftp-transfer-action@v2
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
    user: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
    password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
    source: './local_directory/'
    destination: '/public_html/'
    forceSSL: true
    options: "--delete --verbose"
```

Ensure that sensitive information, especially the FTP password, is always referenced from GitHub Secrets to maintain security.

## Security Notice üîí

When setting up the FTP Transfer Action, it is crucial to handle your FTP credentials with the utmost care to maintain the security of your server and its contents. Here's how to manage your sensitive data securely:

**Use GitHub Secrets**: Always store sensitive information such as your FTP server's host, username, and password within GitHub Secrets. This prevents your credentials from being exposed in your workflow files or logs.

For example, instead of directly inserting your credentials into your workflow file, you should add them to your repository's secrets and reference them as follows:

```yaml
with:
  host: ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
  user: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
  password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
```

**SSL Encryption**: It is recommended to set `forceSSL` to `true` to ensure that all data transferred between your repository and the FTP server is encrypted, reducing the risk of interception by unauthorized parties.

```yaml
with:
  # ... other parameters
  forceSSL: true
```

**Minimal Permissions**: Assign the FTP user account used in the action the minimal permissions required to perform the necessary tasks. Avoid using an account with administrative privileges unless absolutely necessary.

By following these security practices, you can help protect your FTP server and its data from unauthorized access and exposure.

## Sample Workflows üìù

To help you get started with the FTP Transfer Action, here are some sample workflows for common use cases:

### Basic File Transfer

This basic example transfers files from a local directory to a remote FTP server every time changes are pushed to the main branch.

```yaml
name: FTP Deploy on Push
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  ftp-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: FTP Transfer Files
      uses: ercindedeoglu/ftp-transfer-action@v2
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
        user: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
        password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
        source: 'local_directory/'
        destination: 'remote_directory/'
        forceSSL: true
```

### Scheduled Backup to FTP

In this workflow, backup files from a specific directory are transferred to an FTP server every night at midnight.

```yaml
name: Scheduled FTP Backup
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Runs at midnight every day

jobs:
  backup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Backup to FTP
      uses: ercindedeoglu/ftp-transfer-action@v2
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
        user: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
        password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
        source: 'backup/'
        destination: 'backup_destination/'
        forceSSL: true
        options: '--reverse --delete --verbose'
```

### Deployment with Cleanup

This example deploys files to a remote server and cleans up files that are no longer present in the source directory.

```yaml
name: FTP Deploy with Cleanup
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Deploy and Clean up
      uses: ercindedeoglu/ftp-transfer-action@v2
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
        user: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
        password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
        source: 'dist/'
        destination: 'public_html/'
        forceSSL: true
        options: '--mirror --delete'
```

These examples are meant to be templates to get you started. Customize the `source`, `destination`, and `options` parameters to match your project's structure and deployment needs. Always remember to use GitHub Secrets to store your FTP credentials securely.
